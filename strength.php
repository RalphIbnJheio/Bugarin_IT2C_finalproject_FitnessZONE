			 echo"<h3><b>Strength Training Boosts Your Health and Fitness</b></h3> <p>If you knew that a certain type of exercise could benefit your heart, improve balance, strengthen bones and muscle, and help you lose or maintain weight, wouldn't you want to get started? Well, studies show that strength training can provide all those benefits and more.</p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>Strength training also known as weight or resistance training is physical activity designed to improve muscular strength and fitness by exercising a specific muscle or muscle group against external resistance, including free weights, weight machines, or your own body weight, according to the American Heart Association.</p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>The basic principle is to apply a load and overload the muscle so it needs to adapt and get stronger,” explains Neal Pire, CSCS, an ACSM-certified exercise physiologist and account manager at The Gym at Englewood in Englewood, New Jersey. </p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>And what’s important for everyone to know is that strength training is not just about body builders lifting weights in a gym. Regular strength or resistance training is good for people of all ages and fitness levels to help prevent the natural loss of lean muscle mass that comes with aging (the medical term for this loss is sarcopenia). It can also benefit people with chronic health conditions, like obesity, arthritis, or a heart condition</p>", "<br>";


			 echo "<h3><b>Strength Training Makes You Stronger and Fitter</b></h3> <p>This benefit is the obvious one, but it shouldn’t be overlooked. “Muscle strength is crucial in making it easier to do the things you need to do on a day-to-day basis,” Pire says especially as we get older and naturally start to lose muscle.</p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>Because strength training boosts excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, it can also help exercisers boost weight loss more than if you were to just do aerobic exercise alone, Pire says. “[Resistance or strengthening exercise] keeps your metabolism active after exercising, much longer than after an aerobic workout.</p>", "<br>";

			 echo "<h3><b>How to Add Strength Training to Your Routine</b></h3> <p>If you’re looking to add strength or resistance training to your routine you have a lot of options, Pire notes. You definitely don’t need a gym membership or expensive weight machines, he adds. “Squatting on a chair at home, pushups, planks, or other movements that require you to use your own body weight as resistance can be very effective. The more intensity and volume and variety that you can apply to your body the greater the response,” he says. </p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>If you have any health issues, ask your doctor what type of strength training is best to meet your needs and abilities. You can also work with a fitness expert to design a strength training program that will be safe and effective for you.</p>", "<br>";
