			 echo"<h3><b>Benefits of a Cardio Workout</b></h3> <p>Cycling. Running. Dancing. Hiking. Kickboxing. When it comes to cardiovascular exercises, the options are endless to improve your overall quality of life.</p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>But how often should you do cardio to reap the health benefits? The American Heart Association recommends achieving at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity heart-pumping exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise spread out over most days of the week. </p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>“Try getting in a 30-minute workout five or more days a week that raises your heart rate for the duration of the activity,” says Dr. Van Iterson. “Or try three, 10-minute workouts, five or more days a week.”</p>", "<br>";

			 echo"<h3><b>Skin, muscles and weight</b></h3> <p>No matter how you choose to move, being active helps increase circulation, which leads to clearer, healthier skin. Other health benefits can go much deeper than just your skin, too.</p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>When you work your muscles, it increases oxygen supply, therefore allowing muscles to work harder. Over time, regular cardio exercise allows your muscles to adapt to an increased workload, making regular activities seem easier. </p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>When paired with a heart-healthy nutrition plan, safe weight loss comes with doing regular cardio exercise. Not only are you less likely to develop diseases like diabetes, certain cancers and heart disease, but your body can more easily circulate blood. Less sitting time and more physical activity also helps you maintain a healthy weight by burning more calories throughout the day.</p>", "<br>";

			 echo"<h3><b>Sleep and energy</b></h3> <p>There’s a reason why you feel amazing after a workout. Physical exercise helps your energy by releasing endorphins, giving you more, lasting energy throughout your day. When it comes to hitting the sheets, struggling to fall asleep is the last thing you want after that long, busy day. The good news is that cardio helps you doze off faster and promotes REM sleep.</p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>“Make sure to avoid rigorous exercise too close to bed or you’ll be too energized to count sheep,” warns Dr. Van Iterson.</p>", "<br>";
			 echo"<p>Grab your workout clothes and throw on your sneakers, you’ll not only boost your immune system — helping you steer clear of the cold or flu — but by improving your cardiorespiratory fitness, you can also increase your chance of living longer.</p>", "<br>";
